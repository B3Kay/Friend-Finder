About:
This project is mainly designed for mobile devices and therefore with only 
mobile in mind.

The project is still under developement.

post_test.php is for testing and sends a post with all the parameters to the 
web_service.php that reads them and updates the database.
Index.php is the main website, where generate_people.php makes a sql query to
the database to get all the people and their position and shows them in 
a ul list in the browser.
