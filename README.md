Wanna try? Well that's hard...

The database and server host is down. I made this as a school project in my exchange term 
in University of Bradford in the UK. It uses iBeacons to locate mobile devices with bluetooth. 
The id of the device and the iBeacon is matched with a location on the database and are then 
shown in a webbbased interface. 

The interface is made for mobile screens with google material design light MDL framework.

It was a fun project and I'm uploading some screenshots from it.

THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE URL: http://ben.bradweb.co.uk/
But it seems lite its down.
